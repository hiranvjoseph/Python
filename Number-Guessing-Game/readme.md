Number Guessing Program

This program, named number_guess.py, generates a random number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess the number. If the user guesses correctly, the program prints a success message. Otherwise, the program prints the correct number.

To run the program, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the program is saved. Then, type the following command:

python number_guess.py
The program will then generate a random number and ask you to guess it. If you guess correctly, the program will print the following message:

Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.
If you guess incorrectly, the program will print the following message:

Sorry, the correct number was <number>.
The program will then exit.

I hope you enjoy using this program!
