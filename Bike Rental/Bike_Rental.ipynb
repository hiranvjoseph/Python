    "1. **Class Definitions**:\n",
    "   - `User`: This class defines a user with attributes such as user ID, username, and email.\n",
    "   - `BikeStation`: This class represents a bike station with attributes like station ID, location, and capacity (the maximum number of bikes it can hold).\n",
    "   - `Bike`: This class models individual bikes with attributes like bike ID, bike type, and status (whether it's available, reserved, or in use).\n",
    "   - `BikeSharingApp`: This is the main class that encapsulates the bike-sharing application. It maintains dictionaries to store users, stations, bikes, and reservations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Registration** (`register_user` method):\n",
    "   - Users are prompted to enter their user ID, username, and email.\n",
    "   - The `register_user` method creates a new `User` object and stores it in the `users` dictionary using the user ID as the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bike Station Addition** (`add_station` method):\n",
    "   - Users are asked to input the station ID, location, and capacity of the new bike station.\n",
    "   - The `add_station` method creates a new `BikeStation` object and stores it in the `stations` dictionary using the station ID as the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bike Addition to a Station** (`add_bike` method):\n",
    "   - Users provide the bike ID, bike type, and the station ID where the bike will be placed.\n",
    "   - The method checks if the station exists in the `stations` dictionary. If not, it displays an error message.\n",
    "   - If the station exists, it creates a new `Bike` object, adds it to the `bikes` dictionary, and increases the available bikes count in the station.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bike Reservation** (`reserve_bike` method):\n",
    "   - Users enter their user ID and the bike ID they want to reserve.\n",
    "   - The method checks if both the user and bike exist. If not, it displays an error message.\n",
    "   - If the bike is available, it changes its status to \"reserved,\" associates the reservation with the user in the `reservations` dictionary, and decreases the available bikes count in the station. It also prints a message indicating a successful reservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bike Return** (`return_bike` method):\n",
    "   - Users input their user ID to return a bike.\n",
    "   - The method checks if the user exists and if they have an active reservation. If not, it displays an error message.\n",
    "   - If a reservation exists, it changes the bike status to \"available,\" removes the reservation, and increases the available bikes count in the station. It also prints a message indicating a successful return.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Example Usage**:\n",
    "   - The code then provides an example of how to use the `BikeSharingApp` class. Users can input information to register a user, add a bike station, add a bike to a station, reserve a bike, and return a bike."
